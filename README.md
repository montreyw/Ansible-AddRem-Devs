# Ansible-AddRem-Devs
Adding and removing new developers SSH keys

This is a YAML Playbook that allows you to easily add and remove new developer's SSH keys to a Linux server. You would need to edit the "hosts" file to put the names/IPs of the servers you want to control. And then you would run the either the Add or Remove playbook along with the SSH key and everything else is handled for you.
